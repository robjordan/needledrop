Mid-side processing
===================

Convert Left/Right stereo to Mid/Side stereo:

"sox lr-stereo-input.wav mid-output.wav remix 1,2"

"sox lr-stereo-input.wav side-output.wav remix 1v0.5,2v-0.5"

Merge the Mid and Side signals into a stereo file:

"sox -M mid-output.wav side-output.wav ms-stereo-output.wav"

Convert Mid/Sid stereo to L/R stereo:

"sox ms-stereo-output.wav lr-stereo-output.wav remix -m 1,2 1,2i" (note the "-m" flag, meaning that we are adding full amplitude-signals)

Thanks again,
Marlon

High-pass filtering
===================

sox --multi-threaded inputfile.wav outputfile.wav  sinc -L 22 -n 32767 reverse sinc -L 22 -n 32767 reverse

(this command line runs the same filter again in reverse, which for any, doubles its strength while cancelling/making symmetric any phase or transient effects.)

This is steeper than a 10th order Chebychev filter using custom coefficients (60dB/octave).

Suggest 150Hz on side, 15-22Hz on mid.

Speed adjust
============
sox input.wav output.wav speed 1.0264
